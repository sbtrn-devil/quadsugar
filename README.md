# Quadsugar &amp; ValueType #

Quadsugar package contains two decoupled libraries: Quadsugar and ValueType. They can used be independently, or in combination.

## Quadsugar ##

Quadsugar (QS) is browser-oriented, embeddable JavaScript preprocessor that allows to selectively enhance the JS code with some conveniences:

- Improved exception and finalization handling.
- Variable and property references.
- Static and precalculated expressions.
- Static (compile-time) template tags, including framework for custom algebras (operator overloading, in familiar terms).

QS documentation is available [here](docs/README-QS.md).

## ValueType ##

ValueType (VT) is a JavaScript library focused on idea of value-type objects that can be compared and used as map keys using value-equality comparison logic.

It comes packaged with Quadsugar, but is technically independent, so can be easily debundled and used on its own.

VT documentation is available [here](docs/README-VT.md).

## Combined documentation ##

In addition to individual documentation pages, a combined documentation HTML page with more advanced navigation is available here: [TODO].
